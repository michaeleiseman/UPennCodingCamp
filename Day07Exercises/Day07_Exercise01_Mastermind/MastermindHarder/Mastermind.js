/*You should create two functions in this script.*/


/*One function should pick a secret code of four colors randomly
picked from this colors array*/ 
let colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow", "green", "orange", "purple"];
let secretCode =[];


/*The other function should reset the game.  It should be called
when the page loads and when the user presses the "Reset Game" button.
For now, the only thing that this reset function
should do is call the first function to set the secret code.*/
